# 📊 Remote Work Productivity Analysis

This project analyzes how **remote vs in-office work arrangements** impact employee **productivity and well-being**. Using a synthetic dataset of 1000+ entries, we explore trends and patterns to guide company policy on remote work and employee management.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Investigate whether remote workers are more productive than in-office employees.
- Analyze how working hours affect productivity.
- Explore the relationship between well-being and performance.
- Provide actionable insights for HR and management.

## 🧠 Case Study

### 🏢 Business Context
After the shift to remote work during COVID-19, a mid-sized tech company is reevaluating its long-term policy. Management wants to understand:
- Is remote work more productive?
- Does it improve employee well-being?
- How do working hours correlate with performance?

The insights will guide whether to maintain remote setups, return to office, or implement a hybrid model.

### 📦 Dataset
- `Employment_Type`: Remote or In-Office
- `Hours_Worked_Per_Week`
- `Productivity_Score` (0–100)
- `Well_Being_Score` (0–100)

Missing values were intentionally introduced to simulate real-world messiness.

## 📌 Final Insight Summary

- 🏠 Remote workers show slightly **higher average productivity** and **better well-being**.
- 🕒 Employees working **21–45 hours/week** perform the best.
- 🔻 Productivity drops for those working **>60 hours/week**, likely due to burnout.
- 🧘‍♂️ Higher well-being often correlates with higher productivity.
- 🚨 Very low or very high work hours are both associated with reduced performance.

### ✅ Recommendation:
Adopt a **hybrid or flexible work policy**.  
Promote **balanced work hours (~40/week)** to improve both performance and employee wellness.
