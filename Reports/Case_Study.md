# 📄 Case Study: Impact of Remote Work on Productivity & Well-Being

## 🏢 Business Context
After the COVID-19 pandemic, a mid-sized tech company is reevaluating whether to:
- Bring employees back to office
- Continue fully remote work
- Or adopt a hybrid approach

The HR and management teams want to understand how remote vs in-office work affects:
- Employee **productivity**
- **Well-being**
- And whether **working more hours** actually leads to better results

---

## 📦 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains 1000+ anonymized entries with:
- **Employment Type**: Remote or In-Office
- **Hours Worked Per Week**
- **Productivity Score** (0–100)
- **Well-Being Score** (0–100)

Some missing and incorrect values were manually introduced to reflect real-world data challenges.

## 🎯 Objective
To analyze whether:
1. Remote work boosts or reduces productivity
2. Employee well-being is better in remote or in-office setups
3. Working more hours leads to higher productivity or burnout

# 🔍 Questions Asked During Analysis

### Q1. Are remote workers more productive than in-office workers?
✅ **Answer:** Yes, remote workers had **slightly higher average productivity**, with fewer low-performing outliers. This suggests that remote work may help some employees focus better.

---

### Q2. Does working more hours mean better performance?
✅ **Answer:** No. Productivity increased up to **~45 hours/week**, but dropped after **60 hours**, likely due to fatigue. Employees working <20 hours had mixed results, often lower productivity.

---

### Q3. How does well-being compare between remote and in-office employees?
✅ **Answer:** Remote workers reported **higher well-being** on average. In-office employees showed wider variation, possibly due to commuting, environment, or work-life balance issues.

## 📊 Key Insights Summary

| Insight Area              | Observation |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| ✅ Productivity Peak       | 21–45 hours/week |
| ❌ Burnout Risk           | >60 hours/week |
| 🧘‍♀️ Best Well-Being       | Remote workers |
| 🏢 More Variability       | In-office productivity is more spread out |
| 📉 Underwork Effect       | <20 hours/week = lower productivity (possibly part-time) |

## 🧠 Final Recommendation
- Adopt a **hybrid policy** that gives flexibility based on job role.
- Promote **balanced work hours** (~40/week) for optimal productivity and wellness.
- Avoid encouraging overwork (>60 hrs/week) as it harms both output and employee satisfaction.
